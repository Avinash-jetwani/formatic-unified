**Subject:** Re: Amazon SES Production Access Request - Additional Information

Hello AWS Support Team,

Thank you for your response. I'm happy to provide additional details about my email sending use case for Datizmo.

**Application Overview:**
Datizmo is a professional form builder platform that allows users to create, manage, and collect form submissions. Our verified domain is **datizmo.com** and our verified sending identity is **no-reply@datizmo.com**.

**Email Types and Frequency:**
We send **transactional emails only** with the following types:

1. **Welcome Emails** - Sent immediately when new users register (estimated 20-50 per month)
2. **Password Reset Emails** - Sent when users request password resets (estimated 10-30 per month) 
3. **Form Submission Notifications** - Sent to form owners when they receive new submissions (estimated 50-200 per month)
4. **Email Verification** - Sent to verify new user email addresses (estimated 20-50 per month)
5. **System Notifications** - Critical alerts to administrators (estimated 5-10 per month)

**Total estimated volume:** 100-350 emails per month initially, growing to 500-1000 emails per month as we scale.

**Recipient List Management:**
- **Opt-in Only**: All emails are sent to users who explicitly signed up for our service
- **No Marketing**: We send zero promotional or marketing emails
- **Verified Recipients**: All emails go to verified email addresses of our registered users
- **No Third-party Lists**: We never purchase or use external email lists

**Bounce and Complaint Management:**
- **Automated Handling**: Our system automatically processes bounce notifications from SES
- **Suppression Lists**: We maintain suppression lists to prevent sending to bounced addresses
- **Monitoring**: We actively monitor bounce rates and complaint rates through SES dashboard
- **Immediate Action**: Any complaints result in immediate removal from our system

**Verified Identity Confirmation:**
âœ… **Domain verified**: datizmo.com (Status: Verified)
âœ… **Email verified**: no-reply@datizmo.com (Status: Verified)
âœ… **DKIM configured**: Easy DKIM enabled and verified

We are committed to maintaining high sending reputation and following AWS SES best practices.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Datizmo Development Team
