# Webhook Implementation Progress

## Database Schema Additions

We have successfully implemented the database schema for webhooks with enhancements for security, permissions, and performance. Below is a summary of the database changes and their use cases.

### 1. Webhook Model

The core `Webhook` model has been expanded beyond the basic functionality to include role-based permissions, security features, rate limiting, and template support:

```prisma
model Webhook {
  id                 String              @id @default(cuid())
  formId             String
  name               String
  url                String
  active             Boolean             @default(true)
  createdAt          DateTime            @default(now())
  updatedAt          DateTime            @updatedAt
  secretKey          String?
  
  // User tracking & permissions
  createdById        String?
  adminApproved      Boolean             @default(false)
  adminNotes         String?
  
  // Authentication
  authType           WebhookAuthType     @default(NONE)
  authValue          String?
  
  // Security enhancements
  allowedIpAddresses String[]            @default([])
  verificationToken  String?
  
  // Configuration
  eventTypes         WebhookEventType[]  @default([SUBMISSION_CREATED])
  headers            Json?
  includeFields      String[]            @default([])
  excludeFields      String[]            @default([])
  
  // Delivery settings
  retryCount         Int                 @default(3)
  retryInterval      Int                 @default(60)
  
  // Rate limiting & quotas
  dailyLimit         Int?
  dailyUsage         Int                 @default(0)
  dailyResetAt       DateTime?
  
  // Filter conditions
  filterConditions   Json?
  
  // Template support
  isTemplate         Boolean             @default(false)
  templateId         String?
  
  // Relations
  form               Form                @relation(fields: [formId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  createdBy          User?               @relation(fields: [createdById], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  deliveryLogs       WebhookDelivery[]
}
```

#### Basic Fields
- `id`: Unique identifier for the webhook
- `formId`: Reference to the form this webhook belongs to
- `name`: Descriptive name for the webhook
- `url`: The endpoint URL where webhook data will be sent
- `active`: Toggle to enable/disable the webhook
- `createdAt`/`updatedAt`: Timestamp tracking

#### User Tracking & Permissions
- `createdById`: Tracks which user created the webhook
- `adminApproved`: Flag requiring super admin approval before webhook can be used
- `adminNotes`: Administrative notes about the webhook (for moderation/review)

**Use cases:**
- Super admins can review webhooks created by clients before allowing them to execute
- Clear audit trail of who created each webhook
- Super admins can leave notes about webhook configurations (e.g., "Approved for production use" or "Limited to 1000 requests/day")

#### Authentication & Security
- `secretKey`: Used for HMAC signature verification
- `authType`: Type of authentication (NONE, BASIC, BEARER, API_KEY)
- `authValue`: Value for the selected authentication method
- `allowedIpAddresses`: IP whitelist for additional security
- `verificationToken`: Additional verification token for webhook payload

**Use cases:**
- Super admins can enforce IP restrictions on webhooks
- Multiple authentication options provide flexibility based on client's receiving system
- Verification tokens provide additional security layer

#### Configuration
- `eventTypes`: Which events trigger this webhook (e.g., SUBMISSION_CREATED)
- `headers`: Custom HTTP headers to send with webhook requests
- `includeFields`/`excludeFields`: Control which form fields are included in webhook payloads
- `filterConditions`: JSON structure defining conditions when webhook should trigger

**Use cases:**
- Clients can receive only specific events they're interested in
- Data filtering helps with privacy compliance (exclude sensitive fields)
- Conditional triggers allow precise control over when webhooks fire

#### Rate Limiting & Performance
- `retryCount`/`retryInterval`: Controls retry behavior for failed webhook deliveries
- `dailyLimit`/`dailyUsage`/`dailyResetAt`: Rate limiting to prevent abuse

**Use cases:**
- Super admins can set limits based on client tier/plan
- Prevents system overload from excessive webhook triggers
- Provides data for potential usage-based billing

#### Template Support
- `isTemplate`: Flag indicating if this is a webhook template
- `templateId`: Reference to template if webhook was created from one

**Use cases:**
- Super admins can create pre-approved webhook templates
- Clients can use templates for common integrations (e.g., CRM systems)
- Streamlines creation of secure and optimized webhooks

### 2. WebhookDelivery Model

The `WebhookDelivery` model tracks each delivery attempt for audit, debugging, and monitoring purposes:

```prisma
model WebhookDelivery {
  id                String                @id @default(cuid())
  webhookId         String
  submissionId      String?
  eventType         WebhookEventType
  status            WebhookDeliveryStatus
  requestTimestamp  DateTime              @default(now())
  responseTimestamp DateTime?
  requestBody       Json
  responseBody      Json?
  statusCode        Int?
  errorMessage      String?
  attemptCount      Int                   @default(0)
  nextAttempt       DateTime?
  submission        Submission?           @relation(fields: [submissionId], references: [id])
  webhook           Webhook               @relation(fields: [webhookId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

**Key fields:**
- Tracking of request/response data and timestamps
- Error information and retry tracking
- Status management through the delivery lifecycle

**Use cases:**
- Clients can view delivery history for troubleshooting
- Super admins can monitor system-wide webhook performance
- Provides data for analytics on webhook reliability

### 3. Enums

We've added several enum types to support the webhook functionality:

```prisma
enum WebhookAuthType {
  NONE
  BASIC
  BEARER
  API_KEY
}

enum WebhookEventType {
  SUBMISSION_CREATED
  SUBMISSION_UPDATED
  FORM_PUBLISHED
  FORM_UNPUBLISHED
}

enum WebhookDeliveryStatus {
  PENDING
  SUCCESS
  FAILED
  SCHEDULED
}
```

These enums provide structured options for webhook configuration and status tracking.

### 4. User Model Extension

We've extended the `User` model to establish a relation with webhooks:

```prisma
model User {
  // Existing fields...
  webhooks  Webhook[]  // Added relation for created webhooks
}
```

This allows tracking which user created each webhook, supporting audit and permission features.

## Backend Implementation Progress

We have successfully implemented all the core backend components for webhook functionality with enhanced security, permissions, and role-based access control. Below is a summary of the backend implementation:

### 1. Core Webhook Service

#### Webhook Module
Created the NestJS module for webhooks and integrated with the app's main module, registering all webhook-related services:
```typescript
// src/webhooks/webhooks.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [PrismaModule],
  controllers: [WebhooksController],
  providers: [
    WebhooksService,
    WebhookDeliveryService,
    WebhookSecurityService,
    WebhookLogsService
  ],
  exports: [
    WebhooksService,
    WebhookDeliveryService,
    WebhookSecurityService,
    WebhookLogsService
  ],
})
export class WebhooksModule {}
```

#### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
Created comprehensive DTOs for webhook operations that align with our enhanced database schema:

- `CreateWebhookDto`: For creating webhooks with validation and defaults
- `UpdateWebhookDto`: For updating webhooks with partial fields
- `WebhookResponseDto`: For safe webhook responses with masked sensitive fields
- `TestWebhookDto`: For testing webhooks with custom payloads

#### Webhook Service
Implemented the core webhook service with CRUD operations, permissions, and testing capabilities:

```typescript
// src/webhooks/webhooks.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class WebhooksService {
  async create(formId, createWebhookDto, userId, userRole): Promise<WebhookResponseDto> {...}
  async findAll(formId, userId, userRole): Promise<WebhookResponseDto[]> {...}
  async findOne(id, userId, userRole): Promise<WebhookResponseDto> {...}
  async update(id, updateWebhookDto, userId, userRole): Promise<WebhookResponseDto> {...}
  async remove(id, userId, userRole): Promise<void> {...}
  async testWebhook(id, testDto, userId, userRole): Promise<any> {...}
}
```

#### Webhook Controller
Created a RESTful API controller with role-based endpoint access:

```typescript
// src/webhooks/webhooks.controller.ts
@ApiTags('webhooks')
@Controller()
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
export class WebhooksController {
  @Post('forms/:formId/webhooks') {...}
  @Get('forms/:formId/webhooks') {...}
  @Get('forms/:formId/webhooks/:id') {...}
  @Patch('forms/:formId/webhooks/:id') {...}
  @Delete('forms/:formId/webhooks/:id') {...}
  @Post('forms/:formId/webhooks/:id/test') {...}
  
  // Admin-only endpoints
  @Get('admin/webhooks') {...}
  @Patch('admin/webhooks/:id/approve') {...}
}
```

### 2. Webhook Delivery System

#### Webhook Delivery Service
Implemented a robust webhook delivery service for queuing, processing, and retrying webhook deliveries:

```typescript
// src/webhooks/webhook-delivery.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class WebhookDeliveryService {
  async queueDelivery(webhook, submission, eventType): Promise<void> {...}
  async processQueue(): Promise<void> {...}
  async retryFailedDeliveries(): Promise<void> {...}
  private async processDelivery(delivery): Promise<void> {...}
  private async sendWebhook(url, payload, headers): Promise<any> {...}
  private buildHeaders(webhook, payload): Record<string, string> {...}
  private generateSignature(payload, secretKey): string {...}
  private createPayload(webhook, submission, eventType): any {...}
  private evaluateConditions(conditions, submission): boolean {...}
}
```

Key features implemented:
- Webhook queuing with proper payload generation
- Payload filtering based on include/exclude fields
- Conditional delivery based on submission data
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting with daily usage limits
- Webhook security (HMAC signatures, auth headers)

#### Integration with SubmissionsService
Successfully integrated webhook functionality into the submissions workflow:

```typescript
// src/submissions/submissions.service.ts
export class SubmissionsService {
  // Inject webhook delivery service
  constructor(
    private prisma: PrismaService,
    private webhookDeliveryService: WebhookDeliveryService
  ) {}

  // Trigger webhooks on submission creation
  async create(createSubmissionDto: CreateSubmissionDto) {
    // ... create submission ...
    this.triggerWebhooks(form.id, submission, WebhookEventType.SUBMISSION_CREATED);
    return submission;
  }

  // Trigger webhooks on status change
  async update(id: string, updateSubmissionDto: UpdateSubmissionDto, userId: string, userRole: Role) {
    // ... update submission ...
    if (statusChanged) {
      this.triggerWebhooks(submission.form.id, updatedSubmission, WebhookEventType.SUBMISSION_UPDATED);
    }
    return updatedSubmission;
  }

  // Helper method to trigger webhooks
  private async triggerWebhooks(formId: string, submission: any, eventType: WebhookEventType) {
    // ... find applicable webhooks and queue deliveries ...
  }
}
```

#### Webhook Retry Task
Created scheduled tasks to process webhook queues and retry failed deliveries:

```typescript
// src/tasks/webhook-retry.task.ts
@Injectable()
export class WebhookRetryTask {
  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_MINUTE)
  async processWebhookQueue() {...}
  
  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_15_MINUTES)
  async retryFailedWebhooks() {...}
  
  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_DAY_AT_2AM)
  async cleanupOldLogs() {...}
}
```

### 3. Security & Monitoring

#### Webhook Security Service
Implemented dedicated security service for webhook-related security functions:

```typescript
// src/webhooks/webhook-security.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class WebhookSecurityService {
  signPayload(payload: string, secretKey: string): string {...}
  verifyIpAddress(ipAddress: string, allowedIps: string[]): boolean {...}
  buildAuthHeaders(webhook: Webhook): Record<string, string> {...}
  verifySignature(payload: string, signature: string, secretKey: string): boolean {...}
}
```

Key security features:
- HMAC signature generation and verification
- Timing-safe equality comparison to prevent timing attacks
- IP address verification with CIDR notation support
- Secure auth header generation for different auth types

#### Webhook Logs Service
Created logging service for webhook delivery history and analysis:

```typescript
// src/webhooks/webhook-logs.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class WebhookLogsService {
  async getDeliveryLogs(webhookId: string, filters: {...}): Promise<{...}> {...}
  async getDeliveryStats(webhookId: string, days: number = 7): Promise<{...}> {...}
  async getDeliveryLog(id: string): Promise<{...}> {...}
  async retryDelivery(id: string): Promise<{...}> {...}
  async cleanupOldLogs(olderThan: Date = new Date(...)): Promise<{...}> {...}
}
```
